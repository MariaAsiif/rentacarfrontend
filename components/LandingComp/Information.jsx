                            The uncompromising high-performance combination. The Audi RS6 Avant impresses in all its facets. From the high suitability for everyday use to the performance values ​​of a sports car to forward-looking innovation.
                            At first glance a modern designed Avant. But the details speak for themselves. Enormously flared fenders that arch into the rear doors and house the two-tone 22-inch wheels. A distinctive lateral line along the deep black discs. The front brakes: monstrous, with huge red saddles. And right at the front, the Audi starts its light organ as a greeting, also known in specialist circles as "HD Matrix LED headlights with Audi laser light".
