      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>privacy</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">We have written this data protection declaration (version 24.07.2020-311197314) in order to explain to you in accordance with the provisions of the General <span>Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 </span> what information we collect, how we use data and what decision-making options you have as a visitor to this website .

        Unfortunately, it is in the nature of things that these explanations sound very technical, but we have tried to describe the most important things as simply and clearly as possible when creating them.
      </p>
      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>Automatic data storage</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">
        When you visit websites today, certain information is automatically created and stored, including on this website.

        If you visit our website as you are right now, our web server (computer on which this website is stored) automatically saves data such as
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the address (URL) of the accessed website</li>
        <li> Browser and browser version</li>
        <li> the operating system used</li>
        <li> the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL)</li>
        <li>the hostname and IP address of the device from which access is being made</li>
        <li>Date and Time</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="pt-6">in files (web server log files).</p>


      <p className="pt-6">As a rule, web server log files are stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not pass on this data, but cannot rule out that this data will be viewed in the event of illegal behavior.</p>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>cookies</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.
        In the following we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following data protection declaration.</p>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>What exactly are cookies?</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">Whenever you surf the Internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.

        One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are other cookies for other areas of application. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by our website. These cookie files are automatically stored in the cookie folder, which is basically the "brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.

        Cookies store certain user data from you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site again, your browser transmits the "user-related" information back to our site. Thanks to the cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you your usual default setting. In some browsers each cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox all cookies are stored in a single file.

        There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, since each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other "pests". Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-6">For example, cookie data can look like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name: _ga</li>
        <li>Expiry time: 2 years</li>
        <li>Use: Differentiation of website visitors</li>
        <li> Example value: GA1.2.1326744211.152311197314</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="pt-6">A browser should support the following minimum sizes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> A cookie should contain at least 4096 bytes</li>
        <li>At least 50 cookies should be stored per domain</li>
        <li>A total of at least 3000 cookies should be able to be stored</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>What types of cookies are there?</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">
        The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and is clarified in the following sections of the data protection declaration. At this point we would like to briefly discuss the different types of HTTP cookies.
        <br />
        There are 4 types of cookies:
      </p>
      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. For example, these cookies are needed if a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues surfing on other pages and only goes to the checkout later. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if the user closes their browser window. </p>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>Functional cookies</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error messages. In addition, these cookies are also used to measure the loading time and behavior of the website in different browsers.</p>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>Targeting cookies</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">These cookies ensure a better user experience. For example, entered locations, font sizes or form data are saved.</p>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>Advertising cookies</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They are used to provide the user with individually tailored advertising. This can be very useful, but also very annoying.
        <br />
        Usually, when you visit a website for the first time, you will be asked which of these types of cookies you would like to allow. And of course this decision is also stored in a cookie.</p>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>How can I delete cookies?</h2>
      <p className="pt-6"> You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies come from, you always have the option of deleting cookies, only partially allowing them or deactivating them. For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.

        If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, if you want to change or delete cookie settings, you can find this in your browser settings:</p>

      <p className='pt-6 text-[#AE8B41]'>Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome</p>

      <p className='pt-6 text-[#AE8B41]'>Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari</p>

      <p className='pt-6 text-[#AE8B41]'>Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer</p>

      <p className='pt-6 text-[#AE8B41]'>Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies</p>

      <p className='pt-6 text-[#AE8B41]'>Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies</p>

      <p className="pt-6">If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. The procedure differs depending on the browser. It is best to search the instructions in Google with the search term “delete cookies Chrome” or “disable cookies Chrome” in case of a Chrome browser or replace the word “Chrome” with the name of your browser, e.g. Edge, Firefox, Safari.</p>

      <h1>What about my data protection?
        The so-called “Cookie Guidelines” have been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your consent. Within the EU countries, however, there are still very different reactions to these directives. In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this guideline was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</h1>

      <p className="pt-6">If you want to know more about cookies and are not afraid of technical documentation, we recommend  <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265 </span>, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.</p>

      <h1>storage of personal data</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Personal data that you transmit to us electronically on this website, such as name, e-mail address, address or other personal information when submitting a form or comments on the blog, will be stored by us together with the time and the IP Address used only for the purpose stated, kept safe and not passed on to third parties.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="pt-6">We therefore only use your personal data to communicate with those visitors who expressly request contact and to process the services and products offered on this website. We do not pass on your personal data without your consent, but we cannot rule out that this data will be viewed in the event of illegal behavior.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="pt-6"> If you send us personal data by e-mail - thus outside of this website - we cannot guarantee a secure transmission and the protection of your data. We recommend that you never send confidential data unencrypted by e-mail.</p>

      <p className="pt-6">According to <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Article 6 paragraph 1 a GDPR</span> (lawfulness of processing), the legal basis is that you give us your consent to process the data you have entered. You can revoke this consent at any time - an informal e-mail is sufficient, you will find our contact details in the imprint.</p>

      <h1>Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">According to the provisions of the GDPR, you have the following rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR)</li>
        <li> Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) (Article 17 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to notification – obligation to notify in connection with rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (Article 19 GDPR)</li>

      <p className="pt-6">If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection rights have otherwise been violated in any way, you can contact the <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI) . </span></p>

      <h1>Evaluation of visitor behavior</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">In the following data protection declaration we inform you whether and how we evaluate data from your visit to this website. The evaluation of the collected data is usually anonymous and we cannot draw any conclusions about your person from your behavior on this website.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="pt-6">You can find out more about the possibilities of objecting to this evaluation of visit data in the following data protection declaration.</p>

      <h1>TLS encryption with https</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">We use https to transmit data tap-proof on the Internet (data protection through technology design <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Article 25 paragraph 1 DSGVO</span> ). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data. You can recognize the use of this protection of data transmission by the small lock symbol in the top left corner of the browser and the use of the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our Internet address.</p>

      <h1>Google Maps Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">We use Google Maps from Google Inc. on our website. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe. With Google Maps we can show you locations better and thus adapt our service to your needs. By using Google Maps, data is transmitted to Google and stored on the Google servers. Here we want to go into more detail about what Google Maps is, why we use this Google service, what data is stored and how you can prevent this.</p>

      <h1>What is Google Maps?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Google Maps is an Internet map service from Google. With Google Maps, you can find the exact location of a city, attraction, lodging or business online using a PC, tablet or app. If companies are represented on Google My Business, additional information about the company is displayed in addition to the location. In order to show how to get there, map sections of a location can be integrated into a website using HTML code. Google Maps shows the earth's surface as a street map or as an aerial or satellite image. Thanks to the Street View images and the high-quality satellite images, very precise representations are possible.</p>

      <h1>Why do we use Google Maps on our website?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">All of our efforts on this site aim to offer you a useful and meaningful time on our website. By integrating Google Maps, we can provide you with the most important information about various locations. You can see at a glance where we have our company headquarters. The route description always shows you the best or fastest way to us. You can get directions for routes by car, public transport, on foot or by bike. For us, providing Google Maps is part of our customer service.</p>

      <h1>What data is stored by Google Maps?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">In order for Google Maps to be able to fully offer its service, the company must collect and store data from you. This includes, among other things, the search terms entered, your IP address and also the latitude and longitude coordinates. If you use the route planner function, the start address entered will also be saved. However, this data storage happens on the Google Maps website. We can only inform you about this, but have no influence. Since we have integrated Google Maps into our website, Google sets at least one cookie (name: NID) in your browser. This cookie stores data about your user behavior. Google uses this data primarily to optimize its own services and to provide you with individual, personalized advertising.</p>

      <p className="pt-6">The following cookie is set in your browser due to the integration of Google Maps:</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className='font-semibold'>Name:</span> NID
        <span className='font-semibold'>Value:</span> 188=h26c1Ktha7fCQTx8rXgLyATyITJ311197314-5 Purpose
        <p className="pt-6">: NID is used by Google to adapt advertisements to your Google search. With the help of the cookie, Google “remembers” your most frequently entered search queries or your previous interaction with ads. So you always get tailor-made advertisements. The cookie contains a unique ID that Google uses to collect your personal preferences for advertising purposes.</p>
        <span className='font-semibold'>Expiry date</span>: after 6 months</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className='font-semibold'>Note:</span> We cannot guarantee the completeness of the stored data. Changes can never be ruled out, especially when using cookies. In order to identify the cookie NID, a separate test page was created, where only Google Maps was integrated.</p>

      <h2 className='text-[30px] font-semibold'>How long and where is the data stored?</h2>
      <p className="pt-6">Google servers are located in data centers around the world. However, most of the servers are located in America. For this reason, your data is also increasingly stored in the USA. Here you can read exactly where the Google data centers are located: <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de</span>
        <br />
        Google distributes the data on different data carriers. As a result, the data can be called up more quickly and is better protected against any attempts at manipulation. Each data center also has special emergency programs. If, for example, there are problems with the Google hardware or a natural disaster paralyzes the servers, the data will almost certainly remain protected.
        <br />
        Google stores some data for a fixed period of time. For other data, Google only offers the option of manually deleting it. The company also anonymizes information (such as advertising data) in server logs by deleting part of the IP address and cookie information after 9 and 18 months, respectively.
      </p>
      <h1>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">With the automatic deletion of location and activity data introduced in 2019, information on location determination and web/app activity is stored for either 3 or 18 months – depending on your decision – and then deleted. You can also manually delete this data from the history at any time via the Google account. If you want to completely prevent your location tracking, you need to pause the "Web and app activity" section in the Google account. Click "Data and Personalization" and then click the "Activity Settings" option. Here you can switch the activities on or off.
        <br />
        You can also deactivate, delete or manage individual cookies in your browser. Depending on which browser you use, this always works a little differently. The following instructions show how to manage cookies in your browser:
      </p>

      <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome</span>

      <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari</span>

      <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer</span>

      <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies</span>

      <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies</span>

      <p className="pt-6"> If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or not.

        Google is an active participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure data transfer of personal data. You can find more information on this at <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI </span>. If you want to find out more about data processing by Google, we recommend the company's own data protection declaration at <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de .</span>
      </p>
      <h1>Google Fonts Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">We use Google Fonts on our website. These are the “Google fonts” from Google Inc. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe.
        <br />
        You do not need to register or enter a password to use Google fonts. Furthermore, no cookies are stored in your browser. The files (CSS, typefaces/fonts) are requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, requests for CSS and fonts are completely separate from all other Google services. If you have a Google account, you don't have to worry about your Google account data being transmitted to Google while using Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and the fonts used and stores this data securely. How the data storage looks exactly, we will look at in detail.</p>

      <h1>What are Google Fonts?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6"> Google Fonts (formerly Google Web Fonts) is a directory of over 800 fonts that  <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Google</span>  makes available to its users free of charge.
        <br />
        Many of these fonts are released under the SIL Open Font License, while others are released under the Apache License. Both are free software licenses.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">With Google Fonts we can use fonts on our own website, but do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important component in keeping the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimized for the web and this saves data volume and is a great advantage especially for use with mobile devices. When you visit our site, the small file size ensures fast loading time. Furthermore, Google Fonts are secure web fonts. Different image synthesis systems (rendering) in different browsers, operating systems and mobile devices can lead to errors. Such errors can partially distort texts or entire websites. Thanks to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN), there are no cross-platform problems with Google Fonts. Google Fonts supports all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) and works reliably on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). So we use Google Fonts so that we can present our entire online service as beautifully and uniformly as possible.</p>

      <h1>Which data is stored by Google?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">When you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded via a Google server. This external call transmits data to the Google servers. In this way, Google also recognizes that you or your IP address are visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was designed to reduce the use, storage and collection of end-user data to what is necessary for proper font delivery. Incidentally, API stands for "Application Programming Interface" and serves, among other things, as a data transmitter in the software sector.
        <br />
        Google Fonts securely stores CSS and font requests on Google and is therefore protected. The collected usage figures allow Google to determine how well the individual fonts are received. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Google also uses data from its own web crawler to determine which websites use Google fonts. This data is published in the Google Fonts BigQuery database. Entrepreneurs and developers use the Google web service BigQuery to examine and move large amounts of data.
        <br />
        It should be noted, however, that with each Google Font request, information such as language settings, IP address, browser version, browser screen resolution and browser name are automatically transmitted to the Google servers. Whether this data is also stored cannot be clearly determined or is not clearly communicated by Google.
      </p>

      <h1>How long and where is the data stored?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Google stores requests for CSS assets for one day on its servers, which are mainly located outside the EU. This enables us to use the fonts using a Google style sheet. A style sheet is a template that you can use to change the design or font of a website, for example, quickly and easily.
        <br />
        The font files are stored by Google for one year. Google is thus pursuing the goal of fundamentally improving the loading time of websites. When millions of websites refer to the same fonts, they are cached after the first visit and immediately reappear on all other websites visited later. Sometimes Google updates font files to reduce file size, increase language coverage, and improve design.
      </p>
      <h1>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">The data that Google stores for a day or a year cannot simply be deleted. The data is automatically transmitted to Google when the page is accessed. In order to be able to delete this data prematurely, you must contact Google Support at <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://support.google.com/?hl=de&tid=311197314 </span>. In this case, you only prevent data storage if you do not visit our site.
        <br />
        Unlike other web fonts, Google allows us unlimited access to all fonts. So we have unlimited access to a sea of ​​fonts and thus get the best out of our website. You can find more about Google Fonts and other questions at <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=311197314 </span>. Although Google addresses data protection issues there, it does not contain really detailed information about data storage. It is relatively difficult to get really precise information about stored data from Google.
        <br />
        You can also read about what data Google collects and what this data is used for at <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/ </span>.</p>

      <h1>Google Fonts Local Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">On our website we use Google Fonts from Google Inc. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for the European area. We have integrated the Google fonts locally, ie on our web server - not on Google's servers. As a result, there is no connection to Google servers and therefore no data transmission or storage.</p>

      <h1>What are Google Fonts?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Google Fonts used to be called Google Web Fonts. This is an interactive directory of over 800 fonts that Google  provides for free. With Google Fonts, you could use fonts without uploading them to your own server. However, in order to prevent any transfer of information to Google servers in this regard, we have downloaded the fonts to our server. In this way, we act in compliance with data protection and do not send any data to Google Fonts.
        <br />
        Unlike other web fonts, <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Google</span> allows us unlimited access to all fonts.

      <h1>OpenStreetMap Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">We have included map sections from the online map tool “OpenStreetMap” on our website. This is a so-called open source mapping, which we can call up via an API (interface). This function is offered by OpenStreetMap Foundation, St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom. By using this map function, your IP address will be forwarded to OpenStreetMap. In this data protection declaration, you will find out why we use functions of the OpenStreetMap tool, where which data is stored and how you can prevent this data storage.</p>

      <h1>What is OpenStreetMap?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">The OpenStreetMap project was launched in 2004. The aim of the project is and was to create a free world map. Users collect data around the world, for example about buildings, forests, rivers and roads. Over the years, a comprehensive digital world map created by users themselves has emerged. Of course, the map is not complete, but it is equipped with a lot of data in most regions.</p>

      <h1>Why do we use OpenStreetMap on our website?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Our website is primarily intended to be helpful to you. And from our point of view, this is always the case when information can be found quickly and easily. On the one hand, of course, it is about our services and products, on the other hand, other helpful information should also be available to you. That is why we also use the map service OpenStreetMap. For example, we can show you exactly how to find our company. The map will show you the best way to us and your arrival will be child's play.</p>

      <h1>What data is stored by OpenStreetMap?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">If you visit one of our websites that offers OpenStreetMap, user data is transmitted to the service and stored there. OpenStreetMap collects information about your interactions with the digital map, your IP address, data about your browser, device type, operating system and the day and time you used the service. Tracking software is also used to record user interactions. The company specifies the "Piwik" analysis tool in its own data protection declaration.
        <br />
        The data collected is subsequently accessible to the relevant working groups of the OpenStreetMap Foundation. According to the company, personal information will not be shared with any other person or company unless required by law. The third-party provider Piwik saves your IP address, but in an abbreviated form.</p>

      <p className="pt-6">The following cookie may be set in your browser when you interact with OpenStreetMap on our website:</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className='font-semibold'>Name</span>: _osm_location
        <span className='font-semibold'>Value</span>: 9.63312%7C52.41500%7C17%7CM Purpose

      <h1>Google Analytics Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">We use the analysis tracking tool Google Analytics (GA) from the American company Google Inc. on our website. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe. Google Analytics collects data about your actions on our website. For example, if you click on a link, this action is stored in a cookie and sent to Google Analytics. The reports we receive from Google Analytics allow us to better tailor our website and service to your needs. In the following we will go into more detail about the tracking tool and, above all, inform you about which data is stored and how you can prevent this.</p>

      <h1>What is Google Analytics?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Google Analytics is a tracking tool used to analyze traffic on our website. In order for Google Analytics to work, a tracking code is built into the code of our website. When you visit our website, this code records various actions that you take on our website. As soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google Analytics servers and stored there.
        <br />
        Google processes the data and we receive reports on your user behavior. These reports may include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Target group reports: With target group reports, we get to know our users better and know more precisely who is interested in our service.</li>
        <li> Ad reports: Ad reports make it easier for us to analyze and improve our online advertising.</li>
        <li>Acquisition Reports: Acquisition reports provide us with helpful information on how to attract more people to our service.</li>
        <li>Behavior Reports: Here we learn how you interact with our website. We can understand which path you take on our site and which links you click on.</li>
        <li>  Conversion reports: Conversion is a process in which you perform a desired action based on a marketing message. For example, when you go from being a mere website visitor to a buyer or newsletter subscriber. These reports enable us to learn more about how our marketing measures are resonating with you. This is how we want to increase our conversion rate.</li>
        <li>Real-time reports: Here we always know immediately what is happening on our website. For example, we can see how many users are currently reading this text.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Our goal with this website is clear: We want to offer you the best possible service. The statistics and data from Google Analytics help us to achieve this goal.
        <br />
        The statistically evaluated data give us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On the one hand, we can optimize our site so that interested people can find it more easily on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us to better understand you as a visitor. We therefore know exactly what we need to improve on our website in order to offer you the best possible service. The data also helps us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures more individually and cost-effectively. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services to people who care.
      </p>
      <h1>What data is stored by Google Analytics?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Google Analytics uses a tracking code to create a random, unique ID that is linked to your browser cookie. This is how Google Analytics recognizes you as a new user. The next time you visit our site, you will be recognized as a "returning" user. All collected data is stored together with this user ID. This makes it possible to evaluate pseudonymous user profiles in the first place.
        <br />
        Identifiers such as cookies and app instance IDs are used to measure your interactions on our website. Interactions are any type of action you take on our website. If you also use other Google systems (such as a Google account), data generated via Google Analytics can be linked to third-party cookies. Google does not pass on Google Analytics data unless we as the website operator authorize this. Exceptions may arise if required by law.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-6"> The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className='font-semibold'>Note</span>:  This list cannot claim to be complete, as Google is constantly changing the choice of its cookies.</p>

      <p className="pt-6">Here we show you an overview of the most important data that is collected with Google Analytics:</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className='font-semibold'>Heatmaps</span>: Google creates so-called heatmaps. Heatmaps show exactly those areas that you click on. This is how we get information about where you are on our site.</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className="font-semibold"></span>Session duration: Google defines the session duration as the time you spend on our site without leaving the site. If you have been inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className="font-semibold">Bounce rate</span>: A bounce is when you only view one page on our website and then leave our website again.</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className="font-semibold"> Account creation </span>: If you create an account or place an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className="font-semibold">IP address </span>: The IP address is only shown in abbreviated form so that no clear assignment is possible.</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className="font-semibold">Location</span>: The country and your approximate location can be determined via the IP address. This process is also referred to as IP location determination.</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className="font-semibold">Technical information</span>: The technical information includes, among other things, your browser type, your Internet provider or your screen resolution.</p>

      <p className="pt-6"><span className="font-semibold">Source of origin</span>: Google Analytics or us, of course, we are also interested in which website or which advertisement you came to our site from.
        <br />
        Other data are contact details, any ratings, playing media (e.g. if you play a video on our site), sharing content via social media or adding it to your favorites. The list does not claim to be complete and only serves as a general guide to data storage by Google Analytics.
      </p>

      <h1>How long and where is the data stored?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Google has distributed their servers all over the world. Most of the servers are located in America and consequently your data is mostly stored on American servers. Here you can read exactly where the Google data centers are located: <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de </span>
        <br />
        Your data is distributed across different physical media. This has the advantage that the data can be called up more quickly and is better protected against manipulation. Every Google data center has emergency programs for your data. For example, if Google's hardware fails or natural disasters paralyze servers, the risk of a service interruption at Google remains low.
        <br />
        A standard storage period for your user data of 26 months is set for Google Analytics. Then your user data will be deleted. However, we have the option of choosing the retention period for user data ourselves. We have five options available for this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deletion after 14 months</li>
        <li>Deletion after 26 months</li>
        <li>Deletion after 38 months</li>
        <li>Deletion after 50 months</li>
        <li>No automatic deletion</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="pt-6"> When the specified period has expired, the data will be deleted once a month. This retention period applies to your data associated with cookies, user recognition and advertising IDs (e.g. cookies from the DoubleClick domain). Report results are based on aggregated data and are stored independently of user data. Aggregated data is a merging of individual data into a larger unit.</p>

      <h1>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h1>
      <p className="pt-6">Under European Union data protection law, you have the right to access, update, delete or restrict your data. You can prevent Google Analytics from using your data by using the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js). You can download and install the browser add-on from <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de </span>. Please note that this add-on only disables data collection by Google Analytics.

        <p>If you generally want to deactivate, delete or manage cookies (regardless of Google Analytics), there are separate instructions for each browser:#AE8B41</p>

        <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome</span>

      <h1>Google Analytics IP anonymization</h1>
      <p>We have implemented Google Analytics IP address anonymization on this website. This function was developed by Google so that this website can comply with applicable data protection regulations and recommendations from local data protection authorities if they prohibit the storage of the full IP address. The IP is anonymized or masked as soon as the IP addresses arrive in the Google Analytics data collection network and before the data is stored or processed.

        You can find more information on IP anonymization at  <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=de .</span>
      </p>

      <h1>Google Analytics reports on demographics and interests</h1>
      <p>We have activated the functions for advertising reports in Google Analytics. The Demographics and Interests reports include information about age, gender, and interests. This enables us to get a better picture of our users without being able to assign this data to individual persons. You can find out more about the advertising functions at <span className='text-[#AE8B41]'>https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=de_AT&utm_id=ad .</span>

      <h1>Google Analytics deactivation link</h1>
      <p>If you click on the following deactivation link, you can prevent Google from recording further visits to this website. Caution: Deleting cookies, using your browser's incognito/private mode, or using a different browser will result in data being collected again.
        <br />
        Disable Google Analytics
      </p>

      <h1>Google Analytics addendum to data processing</h1>
      <p>We have entered into a direct customer agreement with Google for the use of Google Analytics by accepting the “Data Processing Amendment” in Google Analytics.

      </p>

      <h1>Google Analytics Google Signals Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We have activated the Google signals in Google Analytics. The existing Google Analytics functions (advertising reports, remarketing, cross-device reports and reports on interests and demographic characteristics) are updated to receive aggregated and anonymous data from you, provided you have allowed personalized ads in your Google account.
        <br />
        The special thing about it is that it is a cross-device tracking. That means your data can be analyzed across devices. By activating Google signals, data is collected and linked to the Google account. This allows Google to recognize, for example, when you view a product on our website using a smartphone and only later buy the product using a laptop. Thanks to the activation of Google signals, we can start cross-device remarketing campaigns that would otherwise not be possible in this form. Remarketing means that we can also show you our offer on other websites.
        <br />
        Google Analytics also collects additional visitor data such as location, search history, YouTube history and data about your actions on our website through the Google signals. This gives us better advertising reports and more useful information about your interests and demographics from Google. This includes your age, what language you speak, where you live or what gender you belong to. There are also social criteria such as your job, your marital status or your income. All of these features help Google Analytics to define groups of people or target groups.
        <br />
        The reports also help us to better assess your behavior, your wishes and interests. This enables us to optimize and adapt our services and products for you. By default, this data expires after 26 months. Please note that this data collection only takes place if you have allowed personalized advertising in your Google account. This is always aggregated and anonymous data and never personal data. You can manage or delete this data in your Google account.
      </p>
      <h1>Google Tag Manager Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We use the Google Tag Manager from Google Inc. for our website. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe. This tag manager is one of many helpful marketing products from Google. Using the Google Tag Manager, we can centrally install and manage code sections from various tracking tools that we use on our website.
        <br />
        In this privacy policy, we want to explain to you in more detail what the Google Tag Manager does, why we use it and how data is processed.
      </p>

      <h1>What is Google Tag Manager?</h1>
      <p>The Google Tag Manager is an organizational tool that we can use to integrate and manage website tags centrally and via a user interface. Tags are small code sections that, for example, record (track) your activities on our website. For this purpose, JavaScript code sections are used in the source code of our site. The tags often come from internal Google products such as Google Ads or Google Analytics, but tags from other companies can also be integrated and managed via the manager. Such tags take on different tasks. They can collect browser data, feed marketing tools with data, embed buttons, set cookies and also track users across multiple websites.</p>

      <h1>Why do we use Google Tag Manager for our website?</h1>
      <p>As the saying goes: Organization is half the battle! And of course that also applies to the maintenance of our website. In order to make our website as good as possible for you and all people who are interested in our products and services, we need various tracking tools such as Google Analytics. The data collected by these tools show us what interests you most, where we can improve our services and to which people we should still show our offers. And for this tracking to work, we have to embed the appropriate JavaScript codes into our website. In principle, we could integrate each code section of the individual tracking tools separately into our source code. However, this requires a relatively large amount of time and it is easy to lose track. That's why we use the Google Tag Manager. We can easily build in the necessary scripts and manage them from one place. In addition, the Google Tag Manager offers an easy-to-use user interface and you do not need any programming knowledge. This is how we manage to keep order in our daily jungle.</p>

      <h1>What data is stored by Google Tag Manager?</h1>
      <p>The Tag Manager itself is a domain that does not set cookies and does not store any data. It acts as a mere "manager" of the implemented tags. The data is recorded by the individual tags of the different web analysis tools. The data is passed through to the individual tracking tools in the Google Tag Manager and not saved.
        <br />
        However, it looks completely different with the integrated tags of the various web analysis tools, such as Google Analytics. Depending on the analysis tool, various data about your web behavior is usually collected, stored and processed with the help of cookies. To do this, please read our data protection texts on the individual analysis and tracking tools that we use on our website.
        <br />
        In the Tag Manager account settings, we have allowed Google to receive anonymous data from us. However, this only relates to the use and utilization of our tag manager and not to your data, which is stored via the code sections. We enable Google and others to receive selected data in an anonymous form. We therefore agree to the anonymous transfer of our website data. Despite extensive research, we were not able to find out exactly which summarized and anonymous data is forwarded. In any case, Google deletes all information that could identify our website. Google combines the data with hundreds of other anonymous website data and creates user trends as part of benchmarking measures. In benchmarking, your own results are compared with those of your competitors. Processes can be optimized on the basis of the information collected.
      </p>
      <h1>How long and where is the data stored?</h1>
      <p>When Google saves data, this data is saved on Google's own servers. The servers are spread all over the world. Most are in America. At <span className="text-[#AE8B41]">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de</span> you can read exactly where the Google servers are located.
        <br />
        How long the individual tracking tools store your data can be found in our individual data protection texts for the individual tools.
      </p>
      <h1>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h1>
      <p>The Google Tag Manager itself does not set any cookies, but manages tags from various tracking websites. In our data protection texts for the individual tracking tools, you will find detailed information on how to delete or manage your data.

      Google is an active participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure data transfer of personal data.

      <h1>Google Site Kit Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We have integrated the WordPress plugin Google Site Kit from the American company Google Inc. into our website. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe. With Google Site Kit, we can quickly and easily view statistics coming from various Google products such as Google Analytics directly in our WordPress dashboard. The tool or the tools integrated into Google Site Kit also collect personal data from you, among other things. In this data protection declaration, we explain why we use Google Site Kit, how long and where data is stored and which other data protection texts are relevant to you in this context.</p>

      <h1>What is Google Site Kit?</h1>
      <p>Google Site Kit is a plugin for the WordPress content management system. With this plugin we can view important website analysis statistics directly in our dashboard. These are statistics collected by other Google products. Above all by Google Analytics. In addition to Google Analytics, the services Google Search Console, Page Speed ​​Insight, Google AdSense, Google Optimize and Google Tag Manager can also be linked to Google Site Kit.</p>

      {/* Why do we use Google Site Kit on our website?
      As a service provider, it is our job to offer you the best possible experience on our website. You should feel comfortable on our website and find exactly what you are looking for quickly and easily. Statistical evaluations help us to get to know you better and to adapt our offer to your wishes and interests. We use various Google tools for these evaluations. Site Kit makes our work a lot easier in this regard because we can view and analyze the statistics of Google products right in the dashboard. So we no longer have to register separately for the respective tool. Site Kit thus always offers a good overview of the most important analysis data.

      What data is stored by Google Site Kit?
      If you have actively consented to tracking tools in the cookie notice (also called script or banner), Google products such as Google Analytics will set cookies and your data, such as your user behavior, will be sent to Google, where it will be stored and processed. This also includes personal data such as your IP address.

      For more detailed information on the individual services, we have separate text sections in this data protection declaration. For example, see our Google Analytics Privacy Policy. Here we go into the collected data very precisely. You can find out how long Google Analytics stores, manages and processes data, which cookies can be used and how you can prevent data storage. We also have our own data protection declarations with comprehensive information for other Google services such as Google Tag Manager or Google AdSense.

      In the following we show you examples of Google Analytics cookies that can be set in your browser if you have given your consent to data processing by Google. Please note that these cookies are just a selection:

      Name: _ga
      Value: 2.1326744211.152311197314-2 Purpose
      : By default, analytics.js uses the _ga cookie to store the user ID. Basically, it serves to differentiate between website visitors.
      Expiry date: after 2 years

      Name: _gid
      Value: 2.1687193234.152311197314-7 Purpose
      : This cookie is also used to distinguish between website visitors.

      Name: _gat_gtag_UA_
      Value: 1 Purpose
      : This cookie is used to lower the request rate.
      Expiry date: after 1 minute

      How long and where is the data stored?
      Google stores collected data on its own Google servers, which are distributed worldwide. Most of the servers are located in the United States and therefore it is quite possible that your data will also be stored there. At https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de you can see exactly where the company provides servers.

      Data collected by Google Analytics is stored for a standardized period of 26 months. Your user data will then be deleted. The retention period applies to all data associated with cookies, user identification and advertising IDs.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      You always have the right to receive information about your data, to have your data deleted, corrected or restricted. You can also deactivate, delete or manage cookies in your browser at any time. Here we show you the corresponding instructions for the most common browsers:

      Newsletter Privacy Policy
      If you subscribe to our newsletter, you submit the above personal data and give us the right to contact you by email. We use the data stored when registering for the newsletter exclusively for our newsletter and do not pass it on.

      If you unsubscribe from the newsletter - you will find the link for this at the bottom of every newsletter - we will delete all data that was saved when you registered for the newsletter.

      MailChimp Privacy Policy
      Like many other websites, we also use the services of the newsletter company MailChimp on our website. MailChimp is operated by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA. Thanks to MailChimp, we can send you interesting news very easily via newsletter. With MailChimp we don't have to install anything and can still draw from a pool of really useful functions. In the following we will go into more detail about this e-mail marketing service and inform you about the most important aspects relevant to data protection.

      What is MailChimp?
      MailChimp is a cloud-based newsletter management service. "Cloud-based" means that we don't have to install MailChimp on our own computer or server. Instead, we use the service via an IT infrastructure - which is available via the Internet - on an external server. This way of using software is also called SaaS (Software as a Service).

      With MailChimp we can choose from a wide range of different email types. Depending on what we want to achieve with our newsletter, we can run single campaigns, regular campaigns, autoresponders (automatic email), A/B tests, RSS campaigns (sending at a predefined time and frequency) and follow-up campaigns .

      Why do we use MailChimp on our website?
      Basically, we use a newsletter service so that we can keep in touch with you. We want to tell you what's new with us or what attractive offers we currently have in our program. We are always looking for the simplest and best solutions for our marketing measures. And that's also why we chose Mailchimp's newsletter management service. Although the software is very easy to use, it offers a large number of helpful features. In this way, we can create interesting and beautiful newsletters in just a short time. With the design templates offered, we design each newsletter individually and thanks to the "responsive design" our content is also displayed legibly and beautifully on your smartphone (or other mobile end device).

      With tools such as the A/B test or the extensive analysis options, we can see very quickly how our newsletter is received by you. This enables us to react if necessary and improve our offer or our services.

      Another advantage is Mailchimp's "cloud system". The data is not stored and processed directly on our server. We can retrieve the data from external servers and in this way save our storage space. In addition, the maintenance effort is significantly lower.

      What data is stored by MailChimp?
      Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp) maintains online platforms that enable us to get in touch with you (if you have subscribed to our newsletter). If you become a subscriber to our newsletter through our website, you confirm by email that you are a member of a MailChimp email list. So that MailChimp can also prove that you have entered the "list provider", the date of entry and your IP address are saved. Furthermore, MailChimp stores your e-mail address, your name, physical address and demographic information such as language or location.

      This information is used to send you emails and to enable certain other MailChimp functions (such as evaluating the newsletter).

      MailChimp also shares information with third parties to provide better services. MailChimp also shares some data with third-party advertising partners to better understand the interests and concerns of its customers in order to provide more relevant content and targeted advertising.

      With so-called "web beacons" (small graphics in HTML e-mails), MailChimp can determine whether the e-mail has arrived, whether it has been opened and whether links have been clicked on. All of this information is stored on the MailChimp servers. This gives us statistical evaluations and allows us to see exactly how well you received our newsletter. In this way we can adapt our offer much better to your wishes and improve our service.

      MailChimp may also use this data to improve its own service. This means, for example, that the dispatch can be technically optimized or the location (country) of the recipient can be determined.

      The following cookies may be set by Mailchimp. This is not a complete list of cookies, but rather an exemplary selection:

      Name : AVESTA_ENVIRONMENT
      Value:  Prod Purpose
      : This cookie is necessary to provide the Mailchimp services. It is always set when a user registers for a newsletter mailing list.
      Expiry date:  after the end of the session

      Value:  F1766FA98C9BB9DE4A39F70A9E5EEAB55F6517348A7000001311197314-3 Purpose
      :  The cookie is used to distinguish a human from a bot. This allows secure reports to be generated on the use of a website.
      Expiry date:  after 2 hours

      Name : bm_sv
      Value:  A5A322305B4401C2451FC22FFF547486~FEsKGvX8eovCwTeFTzb8//I3ak2Au… Purpose

      Expiry date:  after 2 hours

      Name : _abck
      Value:  8D545C8CCA4C3A50579014C449B045311197314-9 Purpose
      :  We were not able to find out more detailed information about the purpose of this cookie . Expiry
      date:  after one year

      Sometimes it can happen that you open our newsletter for a better display via a given link. This is the case, for example, if your e-mail program does not work or the newsletter is not displayed properly. The newsletter is then displayed on a MailChimp website. MailChimp also uses cookies (small text files that store data on your browser) on its own websites. Personal data can be processed by MailChimp and its partners (e.g. Google Analytics). This data collection is the responsibility of MailChimp and we have no control over it. MailChimp's "Cookie Statement" (located at: https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/ ) explains exactly how and why the company uses cookies.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      Since MailChimp is an American company, all data collected is also stored on American servers.

      In principle, the data is permanently stored on the Mailchimp servers and is only deleted when you request it. You can have your contact deleted by us. This permanently removes all of your personal information for us and makes you anonymous in Mailchimp reports. However, you can also request the deletion of your data directly from MailChimp. Then all your data will be removed there and we will receive a notification from MailChimp. After receiving the email, we have 30 days to delete your contact from all connected integrations.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      You can withdraw your consent to receive our newsletter at any time by clicking on the link at the bottom of the email received. If you have unsubscribed by clicking on the unsubscribe link, your data will be deleted from MailChimp.

      If you access a MailChimp website via a link in our newsletter and cookies are set in your browser, you can delete or deactivate these cookies at any time.

      Depending on the browser, deactivating or deleting works a little differently. The following instructions show how to manage cookies in your browser:

      Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome

      Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari

      Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer

      Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies

      Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies

      If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or not.

      MailChimp is an active participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure data transfer of personal data. For more information, see https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&tid=311197314 . You can find out more about the use of cookies at MailChimp at  https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/ , information on data protection at MailChimp (privacy) can be found at  https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/ .

      MailChimp order data processing contract
      We have concluded a contract with MailChimp for order data processing (Data Processing Addendum). This contract serves to secure your personal data and ensures that MailChimp adheres to the applicable data protection regulations and does not pass on your personal data to third parties.

      More information about this contract can be found at  https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/ .

      Google AdSense Privacy Policy
      We use Google AdSense on this website. This is an advertising program from Google Inc. In Europe, the company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. With Google AdSense, we can display advertisements on this website that match our topic. We offer you advertisements that ideally represent real added value for you. In the course of this data protection declaration about Google AdSense, we will explain why we use Google AdSense on our website, which of your data is processed and stored and how you can prevent this data storage.

      What is Google AdSense?
      The Google AdSense advertising program has been around since 2003. In contrast to Google Ads (formerly: Google AdWords), you cannot place your own advertising here. Advertisements on websites, such as ours, are played out via Google AdSense. The biggest advantage of this advertising service compared to some others is that Google AdSense only shows you ads that match our content. Google has its own algorithm that calculates which ads you see. Of course, we only want to offer you advertising that interests you and offers you added value. Based on your interests or your user behavior and based on our offer, Google checks which advertisements are suitable for our website and for our users. At this point we would also like to mention that we are not responsible for the selection of advertisements. We only offer advertising space on our website. The selection of the displayed advertising is made by Google. Since August 2013, the ads have also been adapted to the respective user interface. This means that whether you visit our website from your smartphone, PC or laptop, the ads adapt to your end device.

      Why do we use Google AdSense on our website?
      Running a quality website takes a lot of dedication and effort. Basically, we never finish working on our website. We always try to maintain our site and keep it as up-to-date as possible. Of course, we also want to achieve economic success with this work. That's why we chose advertising as a source of income. However, the most important thing for us is that these ads do not disturb your visit to our website. With the help of Google AdSense, you will only be offered advertising that matches our topics and your interests.

      Similar to Google indexing for a website, a bot examines the relevant content and offers on our website. The content of the advertisements is then adapted and presented on the website. In addition to overlapping content between the ad and the website, AdSense also supports interest-based targeting. This means that Google also uses your data to offer advertising tailored to you. In this way you receive advertising that ideally offers you real added value and we have a better chance of earning a little something.

      What data is stored by Google AdSense?
      Cookies are used, among other things, so that Google AdSense can display tailor-made advertising tailored to you. Cookies are small text files that store certain information on your computer.

      In AdSense, cookies are intended to enable better advertising. The cookies do not contain any personally identifiable data. It should be noted, however, that Google considers data such as "pseudonymous cookie IDs" (name or other identification feature is replaced by a pseudonym) or IP addresses as non-personally identifiable information. However, within the framework of the GDPR, this data can be considered personal data. Google AdSense sends a cookie to the browser after every impression (this is always the case when you see an ad), every click and every other activity that leads to a call to the Google AdSense servers. If the browser accepts the cookie, it will be saved there.

      As part of AdSense, third-party providers may be able to place and read cookies in your browser or use web beacons to store data that they receive from the display of ads on the website. Web beacons are small graphics that analyze and record the log file. This analysis enables a statistical evaluation for online marketing.

      Google can use these cookies to collect certain information about your user behavior on our website. These include:

      Information on how to deal with an ad (clicks, impressions, mouse movements)
      Information as to whether an advertisement has already appeared in your browser at an earlier time. This data helps to stop showing you an ad more often.
      In doing so, Google analyzes and evaluates the data on the advertising material displayed and your IP address. Google uses the data primarily to measure the effectiveness of an ad and to improve the advertising offer. This data is not linked to any personally identifiable information that Google may have about you through other Google services.

      Below we present cookies that Google AdSense uses for tracking purposes. Here we refer to a test website that only has Google AdSense installed:

      : Is saved under the domain adform.net. The cookie is set as soon as you click on an advertisement. We were not able to find out more detailed information about the use of this cookie.
      Expiry date: after one hour

      Note:  This list cannot claim to be complete, as experience has shown that Google changes the choice of its cookies again and again.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      Google collects your IP address and various activities that you carry out on the website. Cookies store this information about the interactions on our website. According to Google, the company securely collects and stores the information provided on its in-house Google servers in the United States.

      If you do not have a Google account or are not logged in, Google usually stores the collected data on your browser with a unique identifier (ID). The unique IDs stored in cookies are used, for example, to ensure personalized advertising. If you are logged into a Google account, Google may also collect personal information.

      You can delete some of the data stored by Google at any time (see next section). A lot of information stored in cookies is automatically deleted after a certain period of time. However, there is also data that is stored by Google over a longer period of time. This is the case if Google has to store certain data for an indefinite, longer period of time for economic or legal reasons.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      You always have the option of deleting or deactivating cookies that are on your computer. Exactly how this works depends on your browser.

      Here are instructions on how to manage cookies in your browser:

      Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome

      Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari

      Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer

      Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies

      Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies

      If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. Downloading and installing this browser plug-in from https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996 will also disable all "advertising cookies". Keep in mind that by disabling these cookies you will not prevent the ads, only the personalized advertising.

      If you have a Google account, you can deactivate personalized advertising on the website https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated . Here, too, you will continue to see ads, but these will no longer be tailored to your interests. However, the ads are displayed based on a few factors, such as your location, browser type, and search terms used.

      Google Ads (Google AdWords) Conversion Tracking Privacy Policy
      We use Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) as an online marketing measure to advertise our products and services. We want to make more people aware of the high quality of our offers on the Internet. As part of our advertising measures through Google Ads, we use conversion tracking from Google Inc. on our website. In Europe, however, the company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. This free tracking tool allows us to better tailor our advertising to your interests and needs. In the following article we want to go into more detail about why we use conversion tracking, what data is stored and how you can prevent this data storage.

      What is Google Ads conversion tracking?
      Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords) is the in-house online advertising system from Google Inc. We are convinced of the quality of our offer and want as many people as possible to get to know our website. In the online area, Google Ads offers the best platform for this. Of course, we also want to get a precise overview of the cost-benefit factor of our advertising campaigns. That's why we use the Google Ads conversion tracking tool.

      But what exactly is a conversion? A conversion occurs when you change from a purely interested website visitor to an acting visitor. This always happens when you click on our ad and then perform another action, such as visiting our website. We use Google's conversion tracking tool to record what happens after a user clicks on our Google Ads ad. For example, we can see whether products are being purchased, services are being used or whether users have signed up for our newsletter.

      Why do we use Google Ads conversion tracking on our website?
      We use Google Ads to draw attention to our offer on other websites. The aim is that our advertising campaigns really only reach those people who are interested in our offers. With the conversion tracking tool, we see which keywords, ads, ad groups and campaigns lead to the desired customer actions. We see how many customers interact with our ads on a device and then convert. This data enables us to calculate our cost-benefit factor, measure the success of individual advertising measures and consequently optimize our online marketing measures. With the help of the data obtained, we can also make our website more interesting for you and adapt our advertising offer even more individually to your needs.

      What data is stored with Google Ads conversion tracking?
      We have embedded a conversion tracking tag or code snippet on our website to better analyze certain user actions. If you now click on one of our Google Ads ads, the "Conversion" cookie from a Google domain will be stored on your computer (usually in the browser) or mobile device. Cookies are small text files that store information on your computer.

      Here is the data of the most important cookies for Google's conversion tracking:

      Name: Conversion
      value:  EhMI_aySuoyv4gIVled3Ch0llweVGAEgt-mr6aXd7dYlSAGQ311197314-3 Purpose
      : This cookie saves every conversion that you make on our site after you came to us via a Google Ad.
      Expiry date: after 3 months

      Name: _gac
      Value:  1.1558695989.EAIaIQobChMIiOmEgYO04gIVj5AYCh2CBAPrEAAYASAAEgIYQfD_BwE Purpose
      :  This is a classic Google Analytics cookie and is used to record various actions on our website.
      Expiry date: after 3 months

      Note: The _gac cookie only appears in connection with Google Analytics. The above list does not claim to be complete, since Google also uses other cookies for analytical evaluation.

      As soon as you complete an action on our website, Google recognizes the cookie and saves your action as a so-called conversion. As long as you surf our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google will recognize that you have found us via our Google Ads ad. The cookie is read and sent back to Google Ads with the conversion data. It is also possible that other cookies are used to measure conversions. Google Ads conversion tracking can be further refined and improved with the help of Google Analytics. For ads that Google displays in various places on the web, cookies with the name “__gads” or “_gac” may be set under our domain. Since September 2017, various campaign information from analytics. js saved with the _gac cookie. The cookie saves this data as soon as you visit one of our pages for which Google Ads automatic tagging has been set up. Unlike cookies set for Google domains, Google can only read these conversion cookies when you are on our website. We do not collect or receive any personal data. We get a report from Google with statistical evaluations. For example, we learn the total number of users who clicked on our ad and we see which advertising measures were well received. Google can only read these conversion cookies when you are on our website. We do not collect or receive any personal data. We get a report from Google with statistical evaluations.

For example, we learn the total number of users who clicked on our ad and we see which advertising measures were well received.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      At this point we would like to point out that we have no influence on how Google uses the collected data. According to Google, the data is encrypted and stored on secure servers. In most cases, conversion cookies expire after 30 days and do not transmit any personal data. The cookies named "Conversion" and "_gac" (used in connection with Google Analytics) have an expiry date of 3 months.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      You have the option not to participate in Google Ads conversion tracking. If you disable the Google conversion tracking cookie via your browser, you block conversion tracking. In this case, you will not be included in the statistics of the tracking tool. You can change the cookie settings in your browser at any time. Each browser works a little differently. Here are instructions on how to manage cookies in your browser:

      Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome

      Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari

      Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer

      Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies

      Due to the certification for the American-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", the American group Google LLC must comply with the data protection laws applicable in the EU.

      Embedded Social Media Elements Privacy Policy
      We integrate elements of social media services on our website to display images, videos and texts.
      By visiting pages that display these elements, data is transferred from your browser to the respective social media service and stored there. We have no access to this data.
      The following links take you to the pages of the respective social media services, where it is explained how they handle your data:

      Instagram Privacy Policy: https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875
      The Google data protection declaration applies to YouTube: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de
      Facebook data policy:  https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy
      Twitter privacy policy:  https://twitter.com/de/privacy
      Facebook Privacy Policy
      We use selected Facebook tools on our website. Facebook is a social media network operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. These tools allow us to offer you and people who are interested in our products and services the best possible offer. Below we provide an overview of the various Facebook tools, what data is sent to Facebook and how you can delete this data.

      What are Facebook tools?
      In addition to many other products, Facebook also offers the so-called “Facebook Business Tools”. This is the official name of Facebook. But since the term is hardly known, we decided to just call them Facebook tools. These include, among others:

      Facebook pixel
      social plug-ins (such as the "Like" or "Share" button)
      Facebook login
      Account Kit
      APIs (programming interface)
      SDKs (collection of programming tools)
      Platform Integrations
      plugins
      codes
      specifications
      documentations
      Technologies and Services
      Through these tools, Facebook expands its services and has the ability to receive information about user activities outside of Facebook.

      Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?
      We only want to show our services and products to people who are really interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook ads) we can reach exactly these people. In order to be able to show users appropriate advertising, however, Facebook needs information about people's wishes and needs. Information about user behavior (and contact details) is made available to the company on our website. As a result, Facebook collects better user data and can show interested people appropriate advertising about our products or services. The tools thus enable tailor-made advertising campaigns on Facebook.

      Facebook calls data about your behavior on our website “event data”. These are also used for measurement and analysis services. Facebook can thus create "campaign reports" on our behalf about the effect of our advertising campaigns. Furthermore, through analyzes we get a better insight into how you use our services, website or products. As a result, we use some of these tools to optimize your user experience on our website. For example, you can use the social plug-ins to share content on our site directly on Facebook.

      What data is stored by Facebook tools?
      By using individual Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) can be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address can be sent.

      Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has about you (if you are a Facebook member). Before customer data is transmitted to Facebook, so-called "hashing" takes place. This means that a data set of any size is transformed into a character string. This is also used to encrypt data.

      In addition to the contact data, "event data" is also transmitted. "Event data" means the information that we receive about you on our website. For example, which subpages you visit or which products you buy from us. Facebook does not share the information it receives with third parties (such as advertisers) unless the company has explicit permission or is legally required to do so. "Event data" may also be linked to contact information. This allows Facebook to offer better personalized advertising. After the matching process already mentioned, Facebook deletes the contact data again.

      In order to be able to deliver advertisements in an optimized manner, Facebook only uses the event data if it has been combined with other data (which was collected by Facebook in a different way). Facebook also uses this event data for security, protection, development and research purposes. Much of this data is transmitted to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are used to store data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools used and whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies will be created in your browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools, we go into more detail about individual Facebook cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies athttps://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies .

      How long and where is the data stored?
      In principle, Facebook stores data until it is no longer required for its own services and Facebook products. Facebook has servers all over the world where your data is stored. However, customer data will be deleted within 48 hours after it has been compared with your own user data.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to information, correction, transferability and deletion of your data.

      The data will only be completely deleted if you completely delete your Facebook account. And this is how deleting your Facebook account works:

      1) Click Settings on the right side of Facebook.

      2) Then click on "Your Facebook Information" in the left column.

      3) Now click “Deactivation and Deletion”.

      4) Now select “Delete Account” and then click “Next and Delete Account”

      5) Now enter your password, click on "Next" and then on "Delete Account"

      The data that Facebook receives via our site is stored, among other things, via cookies (e.g. in the case of social plugins). You can deactivate, delete or manage individual or all cookies in your browser. Depending on which browser you use, this works in different ways. The following instructions show how to manage cookies in your browser:

      Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome

      Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari

      Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer

      Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies

      Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies

      If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or not.

      Facebook is an active participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure data transfer of personal data. You can find more information on this at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC . We hope we have given you the most important information about the use and data processing by the Facebook tools. If you want to learn more about how Facebook uses your data, we recommend the data guidelines at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update .

      Facebook Social Plugins Privacy Policy
      So-called social plug-ins from the company Facebook Inc. are installed on our website. You can recognize these buttons by the classic Facebook logo, such as the "Like" button (the hand with the thumb raised) or by a clear "Facebook plug-in" label. A social plugin is a small piece of Facebook that is integrated into our site. Each plugin has its own function. The most used features are the familiar “Like” and “Share” buttons.

      The following social plug-ins are offered by Facebook:

      “Save” button
      Like button, share, send and quote
      Page Plugin
      Comments
      Messenger plugin
      Embedded posts and video player
      Groups plugin
      Visit https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins for more information on how the individual plug-ins are used. We use the social plug-ins on the one hand to offer you a better user experience on our site and on the other hand because Facebook can use them to optimize our advertisements.

      If you have a Facebook account or have visited facebook.com before, Facebook has already set at least one cookie in your browser. In this case, your browser sends information to Facebook via this cookie as soon as you visit our site or interact with social plug-ins (e.g. the "Like" button).

      The information received will be deleted or made anonymous within 90 days. According to Facebook, this data includes your IP address, which website you visited, the date, time and other information relating to your browser.

      In order to prevent Facebook from collecting a lot of data during your visit to our website and connecting it to Facebook data, you must log out of Facebook while you are visiting the website (log out).

      If you are not logged into Facebook or do not have a Facebook account, your browser will send less information to Facebook because you have fewer Facebook cookies. Nevertheless, data such as your IP address or which website you visit can be transmitted to Facebook. We would like to expressly point out that we do not know the exact content of the data. However, based on our current state of knowledge, we try to inform you as much as possible about data processing. You can also read about how Facebook uses the data in the company's data guidelines at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update .

      At least the following cookies are set in your browser when you visit a website with social plug-ins from Facebook:

      Name: dpr
      Value: not specified Purpose
      : This cookie is used to make the social plug-ins work on our website.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Name: fr
      Value: 0jieyh4311197314c2GnlufEJ9..Bde09j…1.0.Bde09j Purpose
      :  The cookie is also necessary for the plug-ins to function properly.
      Expiration date::  after 3 months

      Note: These cookies were set after testing, even if you are not a Facebook member.

      If you are logged in to Facebook, you can change your settings for advertisements yourself at https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen  . If you are not a Facebook user, you can generally manage your usage-based online advertising at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/ . There you have the option of deactivating or activating providers.

      If you want to learn more about Facebook's privacy policy, we recommend the company's own privacy policy at https://www.facebook.com/policy.php .

      Facebook Login Privacy Policy
      We have integrated the practical Facebook login on our site. You can easily log in to us with your Facebook account without having to create another user account. If you decide to register via the Facebook login, you will be redirected to the social media network Facebook. There you can register using your Facebook user data. This login procedure saves data about you and your user behavior and transmits it to Facebook.

      In order to save the data, Facebook uses various cookies. In the following we show you the most important cookies that are set in your browser or already exist when you log in to our site using the Facebook login:

      Name: fr
      Value: 0jieyh4c2GnlufEJ9..Bde09j…1.0.Bde09j Purpose
      : This cookie is used to ensure that the social plugin on our website works as well as possible.
      Expiry date:  after 3 months

      Name: datr
      Value: 4Jh7XUA2311197314SEmPsSfzCOO4JFFl Purpose
      : Facebook sets the “datr” cookie when a web browser accesses facebook.com and the cookie helps identify login activity and protect users.
      Expiry date:  after 2 years

      Name: _js_datr
      Value: deleted Purpose
      : Facebook sets this session cookie for tracking purposes, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are logged out.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Note: The cookies listed are just a small selection of the cookies available to Facebook. Other cookies are, for example, _ fbp, sb or wd. A complete list is not possible because Facebook has a large number of cookies and uses them variably.

      On the one hand, the Facebook login offers you a quick and easy registration process, on the other hand we have the opportunity to share data with Facebook. This allows us to better tailor our offering and our promotions to your interests and needs. Data that we receive from Facebook in this way is public data such as

      your facebook name
      your profile picture
      a registered email address
      friend lists
      Button information (e.g. "Like" button)
      birthday date
      language
      Residence
      In return, we provide Facebook with information about your activities on our website. This includes information about the device you are using, which subpages you visit or which products you have purchased from us.

      By using Facebook Login, you agree to the data processing. You can revoke this agreement at any time. If you want to find out more information about data processing by Facebook, we recommend the Facebook data protection declaration at https://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php .

      If you are logged in to Facebook, you can change your settings for advertisements yourself at https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen  .

      Instagram Privacy Policy
      We have integrated Instagram functions on our website. Instagram is a social media platform operated by Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Instagram has been a subsidiary of Facebook Inc. since 2012 and is one of the Facebook products. Embedding Instagram content on our website is called embedding. This enables us to show you content such as buttons, photos or videos from Instagram directly on our website. If you call up web pages on our website that have an integrated Instagram function, data will be transmitted to Instagram, stored and processed. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Your data will thus be processed across all Facebook companies.

      In the following we would like to give you a more detailed insight into why Instagram collects data, what data it is and how you can largely control the data processing. Since Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we get our information from the Instagram guidelines on the one hand, but also from the Facebook data guidelines on the other.

      What is Instagram?
      Instagram is one of the most well-known social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the advantages of a blog with the advantages of audiovisual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. You can upload photos and short videos to "Insta" (as many users casually call the platform), edit them with various filters and also share them on other social networks. And if you don't want to be active yourself, you can just follow other interesting users.

      Why do we use Instagram on our website?
      Instagram is the social media platform that has really taken off in recent years. And of course we also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, a varied preparation of our content is a matter of course for us. The embedded Instagram functions allow us to enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting content from the Instagram world. Since Instagram is a subsidiary of Facebook, the data collected can also be useful for personalized advertising on Facebook. In this way, our advertisements only get to people who are really interested in our products or services.

      Instagram also uses the collected data for measurement and analysis purposes. We get summarized statistics and thus more insight into your wishes and interests. It is important to note that these reports do not personally identify you.

      What data is stored by Instagram?
      When you come across one of our pages that has Instagram features (such as Instagram images or plugins) built in, your browser automatically connects to Instagram's servers. Data is sent to Instagram, stored and processed. This is regardless of whether you have an Instagram account or not. This includes information about our website, about your computer, about purchases made, about advertisements that you see and how you use our offer. Furthermore, the date and time of your interaction with Instagram are also saved. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram stores significantly more data about you.

      Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume that this is the case with Instagram as well. Customer data are, for example, name, address, telephone number and IP address. It is important to mention that this customer data is only transmitted to Instagram if it has been "hashed" beforehand. Hashing means converting a record into a string. This allows you to encrypt the contact data. In addition, the “event data” mentioned above are also transmitted. Facebook – and consequently also Instagram – understands “event data” to be data about your user behavior. It can also happen that contact data is combined with event data. The contact data collected will be compared with the data that Instagram already has from you.

      The collected data is transmitted to Facebook via small text files (cookies), which are usually set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram functions used and whether you have an Instagram account yourself, different amounts of data are stored.

      We assume that data processing works the same on Instagram as on Facebook. This means: if you have an Instagram account or have visited www.instagram.com , Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is the case, your browser sends information to Instagram via the cookie as soon as you come into contact with an Instagram function. This data will be deleted or made anonymous again after 90 days at the latest (after comparison). Although we have dealt intensively with Instagram's data processing, we cannot say exactly what data Instagram collects and stores.

      In the following we show you cookies that are set in your browser at least when you click on an Instagram function (such as a button or an Insta image). In our test, we assume that you do not have an Instagram account. Of course, if you are logged in to Instagram, significantly more cookies will be set in your browser.

      These cookies were used in our test:

      Name: csrftoken
      Value: “” Purpose
      :  This cookie is set with high probability for security reasons to prevent falsification of requests. However, we could not find out more precisely.
      Expiry date: after one year

      Name: mid
      Value: “”
      Purpose: Instagram sets this cookie to optimize its own services and offers on and off Instagram. The cookie defines a unique user ID.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Name: fbsr_311197314124024
      Value: no information Purpose
      :  This cookie stores the log-in request for users of the Instagram app. Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Name: rur
      Value: ATN Purpose
      : This is an Instagram cookie that ensures functionality on Instagram.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Name: urlgen
      Value: “\”194.96.75.33\”: 1901:1iEtYv:Y833k2_UjKvXgYe311197314” Purpose
      : This cookie is used for Instagram marketing purposes.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Note: We cannot claim completeness here. Which cookies are set in the individual case depends on the embedded functions and your use of Instagram.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      Instagram shares the information it receives between the Facebook companies with external partners and with people you connect with around the world. Data processing is carried out in compliance with our own data policy. For security reasons, among other things, your data is distributed across the world on Facebook servers. Most of these servers are located in the USA.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to information, transferability, correction and deletion of your data. You can manage your data in the Instagram settings. If you want to completely erase your data on Instagram, you need to permanently delete your Instagram account.

      And this is how the Instagram account deletion works:

      First, open the Instagram app. On your profile page, go down and click on "Help Center". You are now on the company's website. On the webpage, click "Manage Account" and then click "Delete Your Account".

      If you delete your account entirely, Instagram will delete posts such as your photos and status updates. Information that other people have shared about you is not part of your account and consequently will not be deleted.

      As already mentioned above, Instagram stores your data primarily via cookies. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies in your browser. Management always works a bit differently depending on your browser. Here we show you the instructions for the most important browsers.

      Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome

      Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari

      Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer

      Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies

      Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies

      You can also basically set up your browser so that you are always informed when a cookie is to be set. Then you can always decide individually whether you want to allow the cookie or not.

      Instagram is a subsidiary of Facebook Inc. and Facebook is an active participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. This framework ensures correct data transmission between the USA and the European Union. Learn  more at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC   . We have tried to give you the most important information about data processing by Instagram. You can learn more about Instagram's data policies at https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875 .

      YouTube Privacy Policy
      We have embedded YouTube videos on our website. This allows us to present you with interesting videos directly on our site. YouTube is a video portal that has been a subsidiary of Google since 2006. The video portal is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. If you call up a page on our website that has an embedded YouTube video, your browser automatically connects to the YouTube or Google servers. Various data are transmitted (depending on the settings). Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all data processing in Europe.

      In the following we would like to explain to you in more detail which data is processed, why we have integrated YouTube videos and how you can manage or delete your data.

      What is YouTube?
      On YouTube, users can view videos, rate them, comment on them and upload them themselves free of charge. Over the past few years, YouTube has become one of the most important social media channels worldwide. In order for us to be able to display videos on our website, YouTube provides a code snippet that we have embedded on our site.

      Why do we use YouTube videos on our website?
      YouTube is the video platform with the most visitors and the best content. We strive to offer you the best possible user experience on our website. And of course interesting videos should not be missing. With the help of our embedded videos, we provide you with additional helpful content in addition to our texts and images. In addition, our website can be found more easily on the Google search engine thanks to the embedded videos. Even if we place advertisements via Google Ads, thanks to the data collected, Google can really only show these advertisements to people who are interested in our offers.

      Which data is stored by YouTube?
      As soon as you visit one of our pages that has a YouTube video installed, YouTube sets at least one cookie that stores your IP address and our URL. If you are logged into your YouTube account, YouTube can mostly use cookies to associate your interactions on our website with your profile. This includes data such as session duration, bounce rate, approximate location, technical information such as browser type, screen resolution or your Internet provider. Other data can be contact details, any ratings, sharing content via social media or adding it to your favorites on YouTube.

      If you are not signed into a Google account or a Youtube account, Google stores data with a unique identifier associated with your device, browser or app. For example, your preferred language setting is retained. But a lot of interaction data cannot be saved because fewer cookies are set.

      In the following list we show cookies that were set in a test in the browser. On the one hand, we show cookies that are set without a registered YouTube account. On the other hand, we show cookies that are set with a logged-in account. The list cannot claim to be complete because the user data always depends on the interactions on YouTube.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      The data that YouTube receives from you and processes is stored on the Google servers. Most of these servers are located in America. At https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de  you can see exactly where the Google data centers are located. Your data is distributed on the servers. This means that the data can be called up more quickly and is better protected against manipulation.

      Google stores the collected data for different lengths of time. You can delete some data at any time, others are automatically deleted after a limited period of time and others are stored by Google for a longer period of time. Some data (such as My Activity items, photos or documents, products) stored in your Google Account will remain stored until you delete it. Even if you're not signed into a Google Account, you can delete some data associated with your device, browser, or app.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      In principle, you can delete data in the Google account manually. With the automatic deletion of location and activity data introduced in 2019, information is stored for either 3 or 18 months and then deleted, depending on your decision.

      Regardless of whether you have a Google account or not, you can configure your browser in such a way that Google cookies are deleted or deactivated. Depending on which browser you use, this works in different ways. The following instructions show how to manage cookies in your browser:

      Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome

      Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari

      Firefox: Clear cookies to remove data websites have placed on your computer

      Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies

      Microsoft Edge: Deleting and managing cookies

      If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow it or not. Since YouTube is a subsidiary of Google, there is a common privacy policy. If you want to find out more about how your data is handled, we recommend the data protection declaration at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.

      YouTube Subscribe Button Privacy Policy
      We have installed the YouTube subscribe button on our website. You can usually recognize the button by the classic YouTube logo. The logo shows the words "Subscribe" or "YouTube" in white letters on a red background and the white "Play" symbol to the left of it. However, the button can also be shown in a different design.

      Our YouTube channel always offers you funny, interesting or exciting videos. With the built-in "subscribe button" you can subscribe to our channel directly from our website and do not have to call up the YouTube website separately. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to access our comprehensive content. Please note that this allows YouTube to store and process data from you.

      If you see a built-in subscribe button on our site, YouTube sets at least one cookie, according to Google. This cookie stores your IP address and our URL. YouTube can also find out information about your browser, your approximate location and your default language in this way. In our test, the following four cookies were set without being logged in to YouTube:

      Name: YSC
      Value: b9-CV6ojI5311197314Y Purpose
      : This cookie registers a unique ID to store statistics of the video viewed.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Name: PREF
      Value: f1=50000000 Purpose
      : This cookie also registers your unique ID. Google receives statistics from PREF on how you use YouTube videos on our website.
      Expiry date:  after 8 months

      Name: GPS
      Value: 1
      Purpose: This cookie registers your unique ID on mobile devices to track GPS location.
      Expiry date:  after 30 minutes

      Name: VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE
      Value: 31119731495Chz8bagyU Purpose
      : This cookie tries to estimate the bandwidth of the user on our website (with built-in YouTube video).
      Expiry date:  after 8 months

      Note: These cookies were set after a test and cannot claim to be complete.

      If you are logged into your YouTube account, YouTube can store many of your actions/interactions on our website using cookies and assign them to your YouTube account. This gives YouTube information, for example, on how long you surf our site, what type of browser you use, what screen resolution you prefer or what actions you take.

      YouTube uses this data on the one hand to improve its own services and offers and on the other hand to provide analyzes and statistics for advertisers (who use Google Ads).

      Google reCAPTCHA Privacy Policy
      Our primary goal is to secure and protect our website for you and for us in the best possible way. To ensure this, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. For Europe, the company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. With reCAPTCHA we can determine if you really are a real human being and not a robot or other spam software. We understand spam to mean any unwanted information that is sent to us electronically, unsolicited. With the classic CAPTCHAS, you usually had to solve text or image puzzles to check them. With reCAPTCHA from Google, we don't have to bother you with such puzzles most of the time. In most cases it is sufficient if you simply check the box and confirm that you are not a bot. With the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version, you don't even have to check the box. You can find out exactly how this works and, above all, what data is used for this in the course of this data protection declaration.

      What is reCAPTCHA?
      reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service provided by Google that protects websites from spam software and abuse by non-human visitors. Most often, this service is used when filling out forms on the Internet. A captcha service is a type of automatic Turing test designed to ensure that an action on the internet is being performed by a human and not a bot. In the classic Turing test (named after the computer scientist Alan Turing), a human determines the difference between a bot and a human. In the case of captchas, the computer or a software program also takes care of this. Classic captchas work with small tasks that are easy for humans to solve, but present significant difficulties for machines. With reCAPTCHA you no longer have to actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish humans from bots. Here you only have to tick the text field "I'm not a robot" or with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. With reCAPTCHA, a JavaScript element is integrated into the source text and then the tool runs in the background and analyzes your user behavior. The software calculates a so-called Captcha score from these user actions. Google uses this score to calculate the probability that you are a human before entering the Captcha. reCAPTCHA or Captchas in general are always used when bots could manipulate or misuse certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.).

      Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?
      We only want to welcome flesh and blood people to our site. Bots or spam software of all kinds can safely stay at home. That's why we're doing everything we can to protect ourselves and offer you the best possible user experience. For this reason we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google. So we can be pretty sure that we remain a "bot-free" website. By using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you are really a human being. reCAPTCHA therefore serves to ensure the security of our website and subsequently also your security. For example, without reCAPTCHA it could happen that a bot registers as many email addresses as possible during registration, to then "spam" forums or blogs with undesirable advertising content. With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.

      What data is stored by reCAPTCHA?
      reCAPTCHA collects personal data from users to determine whether the actions on our website really come from people. The IP address and other data that Google needs for the reCAPTCHA service can therefore be sent to Google. IP addresses are almost always shortened within the member states of the EU or other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before the data ends up on a server in the USA. The IP address is not combined with other data from Google unless you are logged in with your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. First, the reCAPTCHA algorithm checks whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) are already placed on your browser.

      The following list of collected browser and user data does not claim to be complete. Rather, they are examples of data that, to our knowledge, are processed by Google.

      Referrer URL (the address of the page the visitor came from)
      IP address (e.g. 256.123.123.1)
      Information about the operating system (the software that enables your computer to operate. Known operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X or Linux)
      Cookies (small text files that store data in your browser)
      Mouse and keyboard behavior (every action you perform with the mouse or keyboard is saved)
      Date and language settings (which language or which date you have preset on your PC is saved)
      All JavaScript objects (JavaScript is a programming language that allows websites to adapt to the user. JavaScript objects can collect all kinds of data under one name)
      Screen resolution (shows how many pixels the image display consists of)
      It is undisputed that Google uses and analyzes this data even before you click on the "I'm not a robot" tick. With the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, you don't even have to check the box and the whole recognition process runs in the background. Google does not tell you in detail how much and what data Google stores.

      The following cookies are used by reCAPTCHA: Here we refer to the reCAPTCHA demo version from Google at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo . All of these cookies require a unique identifier for tracking purposes. Here is a list of cookies set by Google reCAPTCHA on the demo version:

      Note:  This list cannot claim to be complete, as experience has shown that Google changes the choice of its cookies again and again.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      By inserting reCAPTCHA, your data will be transferred to the Google server. Where exactly this data is stored is not made clear by Google, even after repeated inquiries. Without having received confirmation from Google, it can be assumed that data such as mouse interaction, time spent on the website or language settings on the European or American Google servers are stored. The IP address that your browser transmits to Google is generally not merged with other Google data from other Google services. However, if you are logged into your Google account while using the reCAPTCHA plugin, the data will be merged.  The deviating data protection regulations of the company Google apply.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      If you do not want any data about you and your behavior to be transmitted to Google, you must log out of Google completely and delete all Google cookies before you visit our website or use the reCAPTCHA software. In principle, the data is automatically transmitted to Google as soon as you access our site. To delete this data again, you must  contact Google Support at https://support.google.com/?hl=de&tid=311197314 .

      So if you use our website, you agree that Google LLC and its representatives automatically collect, process and use data.

      You can learn a little more about reCAPTCHA on Google's web developer page at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/ . Google goes into the technical development of reCAPTCHA in more detail here, but you won't find precise information about data storage and data protection-related topics there either. A good overview of the basic use of data at Google can be found in the in-house data protection declaration at https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/ .

      Custom Google Search Privacy Policy
      We have integrated the Google plug-in for user-defined search on our website. Google is the largest and best-known search engine in the world and is operated by the US company Google Inc. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for the European area. The user-defined Google search can transfer data from you to Google. In this data protection declaration we inform you why we use this plug-in, which data is processed and how you can manage or prevent this data transmission.

      What is Google Custom Search?
      The Google Custom Search plugin is a Google search bar right on our website. The search takes place as on www.google.com , only the search results focus on our content and products or on a limited search area.

      Why do we use Google Custom Search on our website?
      A website with a lot of interesting content is often so big that you can lose track of it. We have also accumulated a lot of valuable material over time and as part of our service we want you to find our content as quickly and easily as possible. Custom Google Search makes finding interesting content a breeze. The built-in Google plug-in improves the overall quality of our website and makes it easier for you to search.

      What data is stored by the custom Google search?
      The custom Google search only transfers data from you to Google if you actively use the Google search built into our website. This means that only when you enter a search term in the search bar and then confirm this term (e.g. click on "Enter") will your IP address and the search term be sent to Google, saved and processed there. Based on the set cookies (such as 1P_JAR) it can be assumed that Google also receives data on website usage. If you search for content during your visit to our website using the built-in Google search function and are logged in to your Google account at the same time, Google can also assign the data collected to your Google account. As the website operator, we have no influence on what Google does with the collected data or what it does with it.

      The following cookies are set in your browser when you use Google Custom Search and are not logged in with a Google account:

      Name: 1P_JAR
      Value: 2020-01-27-13311197314-5 Purpose
      :  This cookie collects statistics on website usage and measures conversions. A conversion occurs, for example, when a user becomes a buyer. The cookie is also used to display relevant advertisements to users.
      Expiry date: after one month

      Name: CONSENT
      Value: WP.282f52311197314-9 Purpose

      Expiry date: after 18 years

      Name: NID
      Value: 196=pwIo3B5fHr-8 Purpose
      :  NID is used by Google to adapt advertisements to your Google search. With the help of the cookie, Google “remembers” your entered search queries or your previous interaction with ads. So you always get tailor-made advertisements.
      Expiry date: after 6 months

      Note: This list cannot claim to be complete, since Google is constantly changing the choice of its cookies.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      The Google servers are distributed all over the world. Since Google is an American company, most of the data is stored on American servers. At  https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de you can see exactly where the Google servers are located.
      Your data is distributed across different physical media. As a result, the data can be called up more quickly and is better protected against possible manipulation. Google also has corresponding emergency programs for your data. If, for example, there are internal technical problems at Google and servers are no longer working as a result, the risk of a service interruption and loss of data remains small.
      Depending on which data is involved, Google stores it for different lengths of time. You can delete some data yourself, others are automatically deleted or made anonymous by Google. However, there is also data that Google stores longer if this is necessary for legal or business reasons.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      Under European Union data protection law, you have the right to access, update, delete or restrict your data. There is some data that you can delete at any time. If you have a Google account, you can delete data about your web activity there or set it to be deleted after a certain period of time.
      In your browser you also have the option of deactivating or deleting cookies or managing them according to your wishes and preferences. Here you will find instructions for the most important browsers:

      WooCommerce Privacy Policy
      We have integrated the open source shop system WooCommerce as a plugin on our website. This WooCommerce plugin is based on the WordPress content management system, which is a subsidiary of Automattic Inc. (60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA). The implemented functions send, store and process data to Automattic Inc. In this data protection declaration, we inform you what data is involved, how the network uses this data and how you can manage or prevent data storage.

      What is WooCommerce?
      WooCommerce is an online shop system that has been part of the WordPress directory since 2011 and was specially developed for WordPress websites. It's a customizable, open-source eCommerce platform built on WordPress, which has also been integrated into our website as a WordPress plugin.

      Why do we use WooCommerce on our website?
      We use this practical online shop solution to be able to offer you our physical or digital products or services on our website in the best possible way. The aim is to give you simple and easy access to our range of products, so that you can get the products you want quickly and easily. With WooCommerce we have found a good plugin that meets our requirements for an online shop.

      What data is stored by WooCommerce?
      Information that you actively enter into a text field in our online shop can be collected and stored by WooCommerce or Automattic. So if you register with us or order a product, Automattic can collect, process and store this data. In addition to e-mail address, name or address, this can also be credit card or billing information. Automattic can subsequently use this information for its own marketing campaigns.

      There is also information that Automattic automatically collects from you in so-called server log files:

      IP address
      browser information
      Default language setting
      Date and time of web access
      WooCommerce also sets cookies in your browser and uses technologies such as pixel tags (web beacons), for example to clearly identify you as a user and to be able to offer interest-based advertising. WooCommerce uses a number of different cookies that are set depending on user action. This means that if you put a product in the shopping cart, for example, a cookie will be set so that the product remains in the shopping cart if you leave our website and come back at a later time.

      Here we show you an example list of possible cookies that can be set by WooCommerce:

      Name: woocommerce_items_in_cart
      Value: 1 Purpose
      : The cookie helps WooCommerce determine when the content in the shopping cart changes.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Name: woocommerce_cart_hash
      Value: 447c84f810834056ab37cfe5ed27f204311197314-7 Purpose
      : This cookie is also used to recognize and save changes in your shopping cart.
      Expiry date: after the end of the session

      Name: wp_woocommerce_session_d9e29d251cf8a108a6482d9fe2ef34b6
      Value: 1146%7C%7C1589034207%7C%7C95f8053ce0cea135bbce671043e740311197314-4aa Purpose
      : This cookie contains a unique identifier so that the shopping cart data can also be found in the database.
      Expiry date: after 2 days

      How long and where is the data stored?
      Unless there is a legal obligation to keep data for a longer period, WooCommerce will delete the data when it is no longer needed for its own purposes for which it was stored. For example, server log files that contain technical data about your browser and your IP address are deleted after about 30 days. Until then, Automattic uses the data to analyze the traffic on its own websites (e.g. all WordPress sites) and to fix possible problems. The data is stored on Automattic's American servers.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      You have the right to access your personal data and to object to the use and processing of your personal data at any time. You can also lodge a complaint with a governmental supervisory authority at any time.

      In your browser you also have the option of individually managing, deleting or deactivating cookies. However, please note that disabling or deleting cookies may have a negative impact on the functionality of our WooCommerce online shop. Depending on which browser you use, managing cookies works a little differently. Below are links to the instructions for the most popular browsers:

      Chrome: Delete, enable and manage cookies in Chrome

      Safari: Managing Cookies and Website Data with Safari

If you decide to use this service, personal data, among other things, will be sent to Klarna, stored and processed. In this data protection declaration we would like to give you an overview of data processing by Klarna.

      What is Klarna Checkout?
      Klarna Checkout is a payment system for orders in an online shop. The user selects the payment method and Klarna Checkout takes over the entire payment process. Once a user has made a payment via the checkout system and entered the relevant data, future online purchases can be made even faster and easier. The Klarna system then recognizes the existing customer after entering the e-mail address and postal code.

      Why do we use Klarna Checkout for our website?
      Our goal with our website and our integrated online shop is to offer you the best possible service. In addition to the overall experience on the website and our offers, this also includes smooth, fast and secure payment processing for your orders. To ensure this, we use the Klarna Checkout payment system.

      What data is stored by Klarna Checkout?
      As soon as you opt for the Klarna payment service and pay using the Klarna Checkout payment method, you also transmit personal data to the company. Technical data such as browser type, operating system, our Internet address, date and time, language settings, time zone settings and IP address are collected from you on the Klarna checkout page and transmitted to the Klarna servers and stored there. This data is also saved if you have not yet completed an order.

      If you order a product or service through our shop, you must enter your personal data in the fields provided. This data is processed by Klarna for payment processing. The following personal data (as well as general product information) can be stored and processed by Klarna for credit and identity checks:

      Payment information such as credit card details or your bank account number
      Product information such as tracking number, type of item and price of the product
      In addition, there is also data that can be collected optionally, if you consciously decide to do so. These are, for example, political, religious or ideological beliefs or various health data.

      In addition to the data mentioned above, Klarna can also collect data about the goods or services that you buy or order, either itself or through third parties (such as through us or through public databases). This can be, for example, the tracking number or the type of item ordered, but also information about your creditworthiness, your income or the granting of credit. Klarna may also share your personal information with service providers such as software providers, data storage providers or us as a retailer.

      When data is automatically entered into a form, cookies are always involved. If you do not want to use this function, you can deactivate these cookies at any time. Further down in the text you will find instructions on how to delete, deactivate or manage cookies in your browser. Our tests have shown that Klarna does not set any cookies directly. If you choose the payment method “Klarna Sofort” and click on “Order”, you will be redirected to the Sofort website. After the successful payment you will come to our thank you page. There the following cookie is set by sofort.com:

      Expiry date: after the browser session has ended

      How long and where is the data stored?
      Klarna endeavors to store your data only within the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA). However, data may also be transferred outside the EU/EEA. When that happens, Klarna ensures that data protection is in line with the GDPR, the third country is subject to an adequacy decision by the European Union or the country has the US Privacy Shield certificate. The data is always stored for as long as Klarna needs it for the processing purpose.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      You can revoke your consent to Klarna processing personal data at any time. You always have the right to information, correction and deletion of your personal data. All you have to do is contact the company or the company's data protection team by sending an email to datenschutz@klarna.de .

      Immediate transfer privacy policy
      On our website we offer the payment method "Sofortüberweisung" from Sofort GmbH for cashless payment. Sofort GmbH has belonged to the Swedish company Klarna since 2014, but is based in Germany, Theresienhöhe 12, 80339 Munich.

      If you decide to use this payment method, personal data will also be transmitted to Sofort GmbH or Klarna, stored and processed there. With this data protection text we give you an overview of the data processing by Sofort GmbH.

      What is an "instant transfer"?
      Sofortüberweisung is an online payment system that allows you to place an order via online banking. The payment processing is carried out by Sofort GmbH and we immediately receive information about the payment made. Any user who has an active online banking account with PIN and TAN can use this method. Only a few banks still do not support this payment method.

      Why do we use "Sofortüberweisung" on our website?
      Our goal with our website and our integrated online shop is to offer you the best possible service. In addition to the overall experience on the website and our offers, this also includes smooth, fast and secure payment processing for your orders. To ensure this, we use "Sofortüberweisung" as the payment system.

      What data is stored by "Sofortüberweisung"?
      If you carry out an immediate transfer via the Sofort/Klarna service, data such as name, account number, bank code, subject, amount and date are stored on the company's servers. We also receive this information via the payment confirmation.

      As part of the account coverage check, Sofort GmbH checks whether your account balance and overdraft facility cover the payment contribution. In some cases, it is also checked whether instant transfers have been successfully carried out in the last 30 days. Furthermore, your user identification (such as user number or contract number) in abbreviated (“hashed”) form and your IP address are collected and stored. In the case of SEPA transfers, the BIC and IBAN are also saved.

      According to the company, no other personal data (such as account balances, sales data, credit limits, account lists, mobile phone numbers, authentication certificates, security codes or PIN/TAN) are collected, stored or passed on to third parties.

      Sofortüberweisung also uses cookies to make our own service more user-friendly. When you order a product, you will be redirected to the Sofort or Klarna website. After successful payment you will be redirected to our thank you page. The following three cookies are set here:

      Expiry date: after 2 years

      Note: The cookies listed here do not claim to be complete. It is always possible that Sofortüberweisung also uses other cookies.

      How long and where is the data stored?
      All data collected is stored within the legal retention period. This obligation can last between three and ten years.

      Klarna/Sofort GmbH tries to store data only within the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA). If data is transferred outside the EU/EEA, the data protection must comply with the GDPR, the country must be in an EU adequacy decision or have the US Privacy Shield certificate.

      How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
      You can revoke your consent to Klarna processing personal data at any time. You always have the right to information, correction and deletion of your personal data. To do this, you can simply contact the company's data protection team by sending an email to datenschutz@sofort.com.

      jQuery CDN Privacy Policy
      In order to deliver our website or all of our individual subpages (websites) to you quickly and easily on different devices, we use the services of jQuery CDN from the company jQuery Foundation. jQuery is distributed via the Content Delivery Network (CDN) of the American software company StackPath (LCC 2012 McKinney Ave. Suite 1100, Dallas, TX 75201, USA). This service stores, manages and processes your personal data.

      A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected to each other via the Internet. Through this network, content, especially very large files, can be delivered quickly, even in the case of large peak loads.

      jQuery uses JavaScript libraries to deliver our website content quickly. A CDN server loads the necessary files for this. As soon as a connection to the CDN server is established, your IP address will be recorded and saved. This only happens if this data has not already been saved in your browser from a previous visit to the website.

      StackPath's privacy policy expressly mentions that StackPath uses aggregated and anonymized data from various services (such as jQuery) to enhance security and for its own services. However, this data cannot identify you as a person.

      If you do not want this data transfer to occur, you always have the option of installing Java script blockers such as ghostery.com or noscript.net . However, you can also simply deactivate the execution of JavaScript codes in your browser. If you decide to disable JavaScript codes, the functions you are used to will also change. For example, a website will no longer load as quickly.

      StackPath is an active participant in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure data transfer of personal data. For more information, see https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000CbahAAC&status=Active .
      More information on data protection at StackPath can be found at https://www.stackpath.com/legal/privacy-statement/ and on jQuery at https://openjsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2019/11 /OpenJS-Foundation-Privacy-Policy-2019-11-15.pdf .
